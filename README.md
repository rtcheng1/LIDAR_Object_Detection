LIDAR_Object_Detection
===

[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-2.7-brightgreen.svg)](https://python.org)

Preference: 

Create a virtual environment in any IDE of your choice (I utilized VSCode to set my environment up)

LiDAR file viewer - QGIS 3.10.11

Algorithms to be experimented with:

* YOLO (You Only Look Once)

* SSD (Single Shot Detector)

* R-CNN (Regional - Convolutional Neural Network)

Current criteria to consider in the comparisons using the same item for comparison:

* Elapsed time

* Objects recognized

* Complexity of algorithm

Notes:
---

* OpenCV was utilized on Python 2.7
