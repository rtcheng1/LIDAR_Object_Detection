Filtering -

Basic types of filters:
Low Pass,
High Pass,
Band Pass,
Band Stop (Notch)

Advanced type of filters utilize a combination or modification of the basic types of filters
Advanced filters derive and originate from basic filters.

Example of advanced filters:
FIR filter,
Unity gain filter (Butterworth),


The focus is to experiment with filtering methods on LiDAR data, particularly adaptive filtering if possible.
Some of the current resources I have utilized to test and implement adaptive filtering come from MathWorks MATLAB and Python open source community packages.
